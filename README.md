# WSUFoodies

## Story behind the app
On every college campus, new students/faculy are arriving every semester. These could be freshmen who don't know the area, students transferring from a different
school, or a college professor starting a new job. Since they don't know the location, they have no idea what food spots are good to eat at. No one wants to waste their valuable money on terrible food.

## App functionalities
The WSUFoodies application allows users to post food locations, review locations, and rate locations. To access these features
users will need a WSUFoodies account and then login with the correct credentials. 

#How to use
To use the app simply start up the server and then run the app. The server can be found at: https://github.com/AbdulMahbub/WSU_Foodies_API
